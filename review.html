        <h5>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making <br>
            your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h5>
        <p2>Upon using Visual Studio Code I was totally new and never used it before, now after <br>
            using it, I find it very helpful and simple to use, when making my website visual <br>
            studio code was a bit confusing at first because it would automatically put in the <br>
            closing tags and I sometimes messed up because of this. Trello is something I never <br>
            really use but I can see the appeal of it from a planning standpoint.</p2>
        <h5>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h5>
        <p2>The programs I used where appropriate for the tasks we were given, Visual Studio Code <br>
            seems to be very good for coding tasks and general understanding, Trello was a good <br>
            tool for teamwork activities and planning work as it gives a ‘need to do, doing, done’ <br>
            style of planning, Github was amazing for storing and showcasing your projects for <br>
            future projects or for team projects if the files are needed to be shared. <br></p2>
        <h5>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with <br>
            your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests <br>
            of openness. What would you change?</h5>
        <p2>The strengths of the project I feel I could do most of the code through research and <br>
            trial and error, I am happy the way the website turned out, there could be more but <br>
            with the time I had the result was great. I would make the website more flashy if I <br>
            could change it and if I had more time. The weaknesses of the project were that I <br>
            had to compromise on details because of my lack of experience. <br></p2>
        <h5>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h5>
        <p2>Improvements I could apply would be a full width footer which I could not get to work <br>
            on my finished project, also animated buttons could improve the feel of the website <br>
            also scrolling images for content to fill out the homepage as it seems a bit empty. <br>
            Other improvements I could implement are the header main image could scroll through <br>
            many different images behind the "Develop Coding" sign, i feel this would make the <br>
            website look more eye catching and interesting. <br></p2>
        <h5>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h5>
        <p2>The way I met reqiurements for this project is by aligning everything to the center <br>
            and giving it a set width this made the website very simple to add to, also giving <br>
            big buttons in the body of the imdex made for easy access to the core pages for this <br>
            projects, other pages are in the navigation bar at the top. </p2>
        <h5>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of <br>
            productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your <br>
            website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h5>
        <p2>The benefits of visual studio code is the ease of use and the hint system as you <br>
            code which makes mistakes minimal, I don't feel I could of been anymore efficient <br>
            as I feel I did everything I could to make the website look nice, if I was to work <br>
            in a team to make a website the project would be alot different as when you’re <br>
            working on your on you have the power to dictate the look and feel of the website.</p2>
        <h5>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h5>
        <p2>One simple way to improve productivity is to learn and understand keyboard shortcuts <br>
            as they speed up processes a lot, bookmarks can boost efficiency as they are a direct <br>
            way to get to websites fast, this is good for teamwork and other styles of work which <br>
            needs planning. Other improvements for productivity and efficiency is to use Trello <br>
            more effectively as I forgot it was there to use most of the time.</p2>
        <h5>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what <br>
            would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h5>
        <p2>To improve my productivity next time I would use trello a lot more as I can see the <br>
            benefits and how they can be super helpful in a project, working in a team would boost <br>
            productivity as it would take off some stress of a big body of work, using slack can <br>
            also be good to keep upto date on what needs to be done and be in direct contact with <br>
            the team when not in the same room or at home.</p2>
        <h5>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h5>
        <p2>The way I would test my website is to go over each page and check if they are correct <br>
            and upto standard, then I would get a coworker to go over it and see if I missed <br>
            anything lastly I would open the websites in different browsers and see if they are <br>
            compatible.<br>
