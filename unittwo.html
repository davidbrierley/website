        <h5>1.1. Describing the content and layout for each page.</h5>

            and challenges that come with it. The layout will be a center column with  header <br>
            and contact info in the footer, the bulk of the information with be on three pages <br>
            with six pages over all, one of which with showcase an embedded python game. <br>

        </p2>
        <h5>1.5. Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h5>
        <p2>Copyright law in U.K. protects original contents of work whether that be music, art, <br>
            video or sound, this is protected under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. <br>
            A co existing law, the Copyright Regulations 1992 extends protection to software and <br>
            other forms of online work. Copyright applies upon creation, as soon as your website <br>
            is posted it is protected, however it is highly recommended to register your website <br>
            because websites are subject to abuse which will lead to a civil cause of action. <br>
            Copyright law does not protect logos, you will need a trademark for logos. <a class='ref' href='#ref1'>[1]</a><br>

        <h5>1.6. Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that <br>
            people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them.</h5>
        <p2>Issues that disabled people may face is if they are color blind as the color palate <br>
            for your website may make it hard for them to navigate through the pages. Accessibility <br>
            may also apply not only to disabled people as it allows unhindered access through means <br>
            such as media televisions and mobile phones, adding text alternatives to image tags may <br>
            help visually-impaired users this is done with alt attributes, also the use of a screen <br>
            reader which can translate your website into text to speech or a braille display. <a class='ref' href='#ref2'>[2]</a><br>
        </p>
        <h5>1.7. Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites.</h5>
        <p2>There are two types of image file types, raster and vector, raster is a pixel based image <br>
            normally saved as JPG, PNG, GIF, these file types are mostly used for photos, whereas <br>
            vectors are not pixel based they are built using proportional formulas which makes them <br>
            perfect for logos as they made need resizing and vectors will stop the image pixelating. <br>
            Vector files are normally saved as SVG files. The best video file to use for websites is <br>
            AVI or MP4 as they are coded to be smaller than over video codecs. <a class='ref' href='#ref3'>[3]</a><br>
