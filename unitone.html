        <h5>1.1. Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h5>
        <p2>One of the many purposes of Information Technology is the easy retrieval of information <br>
            also the accuracy and consistency of said information, In business Information <br>
            Technology's purpose is to help make the right choices by giving people mass amount of <br>
            information at their fingertips. Information Technology can help with customer feedback <br>
            and have an instant connection with what needs to change or be kept. Data storage has <br>
            been a big part of renovating business and of most recent Cloud storage which means the <br>
            manager can manage or monitor their resources from anywhere in the world by using a PC <br>
            or laptop, most tech companies use these cloud based systems to manage the workplace <br>
            worldwide. <a class='ref' href='#ref1'>[1]</a><br>
        </p2>
        <h5>1.2. Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects <br>
            successfully.</h5>
        <p2>To be successful in a project what is needed is to set clear goals and assign people to <br>
            certain tasks, give objectives and requirements for the project, objectives are a key <br>
            factor to a project's success adding clarity and direction and keeps the project scope <br>
            from not getting too out of control. Setting milestones within your project plan can <br>
            value the project as it gives a clear vision for upcoming deadlines. Being aware of <br>
            risks is a must and a risk assessment enables the calculation of potential risks and <br>
            can minimize setbacks as you are able to respond and address issues as they come. <a class='ref' href='#ref2'>[2]</a><br>
        </p2>
        <h5>1.3. Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website.</h5>
        <p2>Planning for a task is a long process which includes ideas and themes of the idea, <br>
            brainstorming how to implement the idea and the scale of idea, skills needed and skills <br>
            I could use to improve and which parts I will cover, working up a plan by gathering <br>
            information and pictures and other resources, give yourself deadlines to meet and fix <br>
            any mistakes made, product a working website and include proof of planning. <a class='ref' href='#ref3'>[3]</a><br>
        </p2>
        <h5>1.4. Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h5>
        <p2>There are many risks that might impact a project these include, not enough support for <br>
            the project, disengagement of the project, conflict within the team which can take form <br>
            in combative natures and disagreements on the direction of the project, uncontrollable <br>
            growth of the project, inaccurate cost estimates, lack of management meaning the manager <br>
            has no interest or too busy with other projects, changes made are of low quality, <br>
            misunderstanding between the team and unachievable expectations, resources or training <br>
            not fully gained, flexibility in design is not up to par and many others. <a class='ref' href='#ref4'>[4]</a><br>
        </p2>
        <h5>1.5. Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h5>
        <p2>I would first see the strengths and weaknesses of software available then I would list <br>
            the software into must-have and nice-to-have features in order of priority, then <br>
            establish a shortlist of software suitable and mesh well with the job at hand, next <br>
            ask for demos or download trial versions of software to be 100% that its what you need <br>
            for your project and that the teams are ok with said software. <a class='ref' href='#ref5'>[5]</a><br>
        </p2>
        <h5>1.6. Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you <br>
            achieve your outcomes.</h5>
        <p2>Trello was my chosen technology for project management as it layouts a clear and easy <br>
            plan to follow, github is also good for project storage for future viewing or call <br>
            backs, when it comes to trello a “kanban” system is perfect for management as it <br>
            gives you a need-to-do, doing, and done, so anyone looking at it can see what needs <br>
            to be done and what others are working on, and for github the major perk is its free <br>
            to use and great for code storage also can store images. <br>
        </p2>
        <h5>1.7. Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How <br>
            does GDPR impact digital projects?</h5>
        <p2>The General Data Protection Regulation primary aim is to give people control over <br>
            their information, A data protection impact assessment helps identify and minimise <br>
            data protection risks of projects. With GDPR puts the customer in the driver’s seat <br>
            and the task of complying with regulations fall upon the businesses, non-complaints <br>
            are fined 4% of global revenue. General Data Protection has changed a lot of things <br>
            for companies, for example the sales teams prospects or the way marketing activities <br>
            are managed, changes in application forms had to be made for double opt-in rules <br>
            meaning they will have to fill in a form or tick a box to confirm their actions. <a class='ref' href='#ref6'>[6]</a><br>
